# Pont

Pont is a library and protocol that empowers any backend to run as a SPA. It means « bridge » in French.
It enables a seamless and unobtrusive approach to navigating the complexities of an API, providing a distinct layer of abstraction that shields developers from the underlying intricacies. Inspired by Inertia, Pont addresses the shortcomings of its inspiration framework while offering a more minimalist yet powerful interface.
